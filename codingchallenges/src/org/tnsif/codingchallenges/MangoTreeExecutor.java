/*Darshan is so much interested in gardening and hence he plans more trees in his garden. He plans trees in a rectangular 
*fashion with the order of rows and columns & numbers the trees in a row wise order. He planted the mango tree only 
*in the first row, first column and last column. So given the tree number(t) and row and column number(n) as input your task is to find
*out whether the given tree is a mango tree or not.
*t=11 n=5
