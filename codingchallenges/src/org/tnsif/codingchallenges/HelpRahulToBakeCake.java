Rahul decided to bake the Napoleon cake. He baked n dry layers first, and then put them on each other in one stack(see image), adding some cream. Rahul started with an empty plate, and performed the following steps n times:

place a new dry layer of cake on the top of the stack;
after the i-th layer is placed, pour ai units of cream on top of the stack.
When x units of cream are poured on the top of the stack, the top x layers of the cake get wet in the cream. If there are fewer than x layers, all layers get wet. If x=0, no layer gets wet.

The picture represents the example test case.
Help Rahul determine which layers of the cake eventually get wet when the process is over, and which don’t.

Input: Each test case contains n integers arr[0], arr[1], … arr[n-1] — where arr[i] is the amount of cream poured on the cake after adding ith layer.

Output: Print array of n integers. The i-th of the integers should be equal to 1 if the i-th layer is wet, and 0 otherwise. Let’s see an example.

Example Test Case:

Input: n = 6 arr[6] = 0 3 0 0 1 3

Ouput: 1 1 0 1 1 1
